description: "Human-robot collaboration (HRC) introduces significant safety challenges, particularly in protecting
human operators working alongside collaborative robots (cobots). While current ISO standards emphasize risk assessment 
and hazard identification, these procedures are often insufficient for addressing the complexity of HRC environments, 
which involve numerous design factors and dynamic interactions."
