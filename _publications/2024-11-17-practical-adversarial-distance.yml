description: "Adversarial distance is a highly informative measure of robustness that enjoys little attention in the adversarial robustness domain. 
We built a practical attack algorithm to evaluate this measure more effectively than implementations in the popular Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART).
We also combine this upper-bound estimator with the popular lower-bound estimation method CLEVER, showing CLEVERs inability to calculate a correct lower bound in many cases."
