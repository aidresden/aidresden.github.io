description: "Psychological and ethical criteria are to date not systematically covered in the system design process. We suggest to extend existing model-based 
system engineering approaches by new elements that are capable to capture these criteria and, in particular, allow for an 
implementation of psychological risk analysis and ethical evaluation of work systems already in the design phase."
