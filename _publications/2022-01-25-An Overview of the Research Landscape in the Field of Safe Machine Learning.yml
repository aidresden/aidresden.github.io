description: "The applicability of ML components in safety-critical systems will significantly depend on whether 
it will be possible to provide a comprehensive proof of their safety. Three research questions (RQ) are answered 
in order to provide a starting point for future activities towards the risk assessment of safety-critical systems containing ML components."
