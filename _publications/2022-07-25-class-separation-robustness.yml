description: "We adapt the idea of measuring the minimum class separation for classification datasets to obtain a well interpretable robustness criterion as well as 
a novel corruption robustness metric. We experiment with training and testing on data with different amounts of noise and discuss a trade-off between robustness and accuracy."
