description: "Robustness is a fundamental pillar of Machine Learning (ML) classifiers, substantially determining their reliability. 
Methods for assessing classifier robustness are therefore essential. In this work, we address the challenge of evaluating corruption robustness in a way 
that allows comparability and interpretability on a given dataset. We propose a test data augmentation method that uses a robustness distance  derived 
from the datasets minimal class separation distance."
