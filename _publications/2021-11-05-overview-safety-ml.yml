description: "In order to provide a systematic overview of research on safe machine learning, we defined a hierarchy of safety-related machine learning properties
and visualised the search results in this area in literature maps. We categorised the methods identified in the field according to the machine learning life cycle. 
Finally, we compared the methods with those required to achieve functional safety of traditional software according to ISO 61508."
