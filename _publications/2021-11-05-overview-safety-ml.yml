description: "In order to conduct a systematic overview of research on safe machine learning, we defined a hierarchy of machine learning properties related 
to safety and visualized search results in the field in literature maps. We categorized methods identified in the field according to the machine learning lifecycle. 
Finally, we compared the methods to those required to achieve functional safety of traditional software according to ISO 61508."
