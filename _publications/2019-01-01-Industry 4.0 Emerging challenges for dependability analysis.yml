description: "Industry 4.0 brings new challenges for the quantitative methods for the evaluation of system dependability properties such as reliability 
and safety. In this paper, we recall relevant Industry 4.0 and dependability concepts and provide an overview of available reliability and safety metrics 
and evaluation methods including event trees, fault trees, reliability block diagrams, and more sophisticated dynamic methods based on Markov chain models. 
The special focus is on the model-based application of these methods."
