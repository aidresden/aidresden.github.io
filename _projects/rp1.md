<p>In this project, challenges for the risk analysis of complex industrial systems were investigated. A major workpackage focussed on those challenges posed by the integration of AI modules into industrial machinery. For industrial use cases in particular, important safety-related properties of AI were identified, with the main focus lying on the robustness of such systems.Robustness describes the stability of an AI model's outputs when confronted with variations in its input and is a fundamental pillar of the model's dependability.</p>
