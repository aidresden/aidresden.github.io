<p>In collaboration with the Technical University of Dresden and the Construction Future Lab (https://cflab.de/), the safety of workers on construction sites is the focus of this data generation project. Assistance systems can be utilized for person detection in order to prevent physical harm of machinery colliding with workers on such sites.Therefore, a dataset of persons on real construction sites was created. With this dataset, researchers and developers can investigate the reliability of object detection models in such a scenario on realistic data and derive conclusions on particularly challenging scenarios, 
robustness challenges as well as parametrization choices.</p>
