<h2>Person detection on construction sites</h2>
<img src="/assets/research_img/project1.jpg" alt="Person detection on construction sites" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
<p>In partnership with the Technical University of Dresden and the Construction Future Lab (https://cflab.de/), this project aims to enhance worker safety on construction sites. 
A unique image dataset of individuals on active construction sites has been developed to evaluate the detection capabilities of driver assistance systems that aim to prevent collisions with workers on such sites. By leveraging this dataset, researchers and developers can assess the effectiveness of object/person detection models in real-world conditions, gaining insights into challenging scenarios, robustness 
requirements, and optimal parameter settings for these safety systems.</p>
