<p> In this project, we collect industrial time series for pick & place operations and milling applications. We gather the data through internal and external sensors and simulate malfunctions. Those safety critical events include tool wear, wrong process acceleration, and fault in components for picking objects.The goal of this project is the reliable detection of safety critical events. Furthermore, we aim for a realistic setup and experimental design for industrial time series in different enviornments and various malfunctions.</p>
