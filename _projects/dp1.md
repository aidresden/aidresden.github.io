<h2>Data Project ABID</h2>

<p>Publicly available, real-world datasets of human-robot interactions (HRIs) are scarce, as the creation of safety-critical scenarios is a challenging process and often involves the use of proprietary methods. This data project proposes a pipeline and methods to create a labelled dataset using an image-grade 3D LiDAR sensor and an RGB-D camera, as well as the dataset ABiD, combining relevant data for training and evaluating AI models that monitor and evaluate HRI scenarios from a safety perspective. This dataset is automatically labeled with 3D bounding boxes of individual human limbs and joints of the robot. Each bounding box is also labeled with a risk index, derived from a risk assessment process. The project was conducted by Proximity Robotics and the group of Jun.-Prof. Andrey Morozov at the Institute of Industrial Automation and Software Engineering at the University of Stuttgart.</p>
