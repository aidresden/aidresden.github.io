<p> In collaboration with the Fraunhofer IPA, we collect real world data from table milling machines. Each process is described through several internal- and external variables being captured with the internal control system and sensors.Table milling machines are widely used industrial machines that are characterized by a high degree of manual work and fast rotating tools. The danger of unintentional synchronized milling can occur which results in a so called kick back event. The goal of this project is the automated and reliable prediction of sudden kick back events to mitigate the risk for workers and ensure safe deployment.</p>
