  - title: "Generation of safety-relevant industrial data for AI applications - construction site person detection"
    description: |
      In collaboration with the Technical University of Dresden and the Construction Future Lab (https://cflab.de/), the safety of workers on construction sites is the focus of this data generation project. 
      Assistance systems can be utilized for person detection in order to prevent physical harm of machinery colliding with workers on such sites. 
      Therefore, a dataset of persons on real construction sites was created. 
      With this dataset, researchers and developers can investigate the reliability of object detection models in such a scenario on realistic data and derive conclusions on particularly challenging scenarios, 
      robustness challenges as well as parametrization choices.

  - title: "Risk assessment of a cyber-physical systems model for Industrie 4.0 applications - workpackage AI-safety"
    description: |
      In this project, challenges for the risk analysis of complex industrial systems were investigated. 
      A major workpackage focussed on those challenges posed by the integration of AI modules into industrial machinery. 
      For industrial use cases in particular, important safety-related properties of AI were identified, with the main focus lying on the robustness of such systems. 
      Robustness describes the stability of an AI model's outputs when confronted with variations in its input and is a fundamental pillar of the model's dependability.
