  - title: "Person Detection on Construction Sites"
    description: |
      In collaboration with the Technical University of Dresden and the Construction Future Lab (https://cflab.de/), the safety of workers on construction sites is the focus of this data generation project. 
      A dataset of persons on real construction sites was created. Driver assistance systems can be utilized for person detection in order to prevent physical harm of machinery colliding with workers on such sites. 
      With this dataset, researchers and developers can evaluate the reliability of object detection models for such assistance systems on realistic data and derive conclusions on particularly challenging scenarios, 
      robustness challenges as well as parametrization choices.
      In partnership with the Technical University of Dresden and the Construction Future Lab (https://cflab.de/), this project aims to enhance worker safety on construction sites. 
      A unique image dataset of individuals on active construction sites has been developed to evaluate the detection capabilities of driver assistance systems that aim to prevent collisions with workers on such sites.
      By leveraging this dataset, researchers and developers can assess the effectiveness of object/person detection models in real-world conditions, gaining insights into challenging scenarios, robustness 
      requirements, and optimal parameter settings for these safety systems.

  - title: "Risk assessment of a cyber-physical systems model for Industrie 4.0 applications - workpackage AI-safety"
    description: |
      In this project, challenges for the risk analysis of complex industrial systems were investigated. 
      A major workpackage focussed on those challenges posed by the integration of AI modules into industrial machinery. 
      For industrial use cases in particular, important safety-related properties of AI were identified, with the main focus lying on the robustness of such systems. 
      Robustness describes the stability of an AI model's outputs when confronted with variations in its input and is a fundamental pillar of the model's dependability.
