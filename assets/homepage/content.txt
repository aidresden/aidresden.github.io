An important prerequisite for providing occupational safety is the safety of products. According to the European Machinery Directive (both, 2006 and 2023) a risk assessment has to be conducted before placing a new machine on the European market. Therefore, applicability of ML components in safety-critical systems will significantly depend on whether it will be possible to provide a comprehensive proof of their safety.
The AI research team in Dresden focuses on such high-risk applications of AI in machinery. These are for example Machine Learning (ML) algorithms as part of a safety system. We aim to bridge the gap between traditional safety engineering standards and the evolving requirements of ML and AI development, ensuring that these innovative technologies can meet stringent regulatory and safety demands. Through our research, we contribute to setting the foundations for reliable, compliant, and safe AI deployment in industrial environments.
